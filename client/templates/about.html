  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I want to tell you a new way to fund raise for software, ebooks and other digital content
  </p>
  <ul id='content-list'>
    <li>
      The idea is that if the cost per item is close to $0, then the buyer should pay close to $0.      
    </li>
    <li>
      The problem is that there is an upfront cost for creating it before it becomes cheaply available.
    </li>
    <li>
      The solution is to set an initial price at the beginning, i.e. the fund-raising stage, but refund the early buyers at a later stage when more people decide to purchase it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The price can eventually reach $0; this happens when a number of people are willing to give up a part of the refund, which accumulates to cover the original cost of the creation. (This cost of making the product free is known as the cost of freedom)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I learn about this from <a href="http://www.fund-io.com">Fund I/O</a>. It's an interesting idea, blurring the lines between paying vs donating, thinking vs creating, and giving vs receiving. However, this has not been implemented as a platform for real projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's why I have decided to build a platform for Cornell students to put projects up. Currently, we will run it on fake money.

  <p>To get started, create a product with your idea.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="/addProduct" class='btn btn-primary'>Create a product</a></div>

  <p>If you are not ready to build a product, but have ideas of what you want to have, visit <a href="http://ideas.on.meteor.com">ideas.on.meteor</a> to express it there so that you or others can convert it to a product to be funded here.</p>
