  <h1>Fund sharing</h1>
  <p>A new way of fund raising for cheaply-replicated products</p>
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    There is a new way to fund raise for things like software, ebooks and other digital content. Here is a short summary from <a href="http://www.fund-io.com">Fund I/O</a>
  </p>
  <ul id='content-list'>
    <li>
      The idea is that if the cost per item is close to $0, then the buyer should pay close to $0.      
    </li>
    <li>
      The problem is that there is an upfront cost for creating it before it becomes cheaply available.
    </li>
    <li>
      The solution is to set a higher price at the beginning, but refund the early buyer when the price is lowered due to more people paying for it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The price can reach $0; this happens when a number of people are willing to give up a part of the refund, which accumulates to cover the original cost of the creation. (The refund you give up is known as the cost of freedom)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The problem is that we don't have any real evidence of whether it will work. In fact, Fund I/O is looking for actual projects to participate before it plans to build an actual platform.
  </p>
  <p>That's why I have decided to build a platform that runs on fake money to try it out using StartUp Ideas.</p>
  <p>To get started, create a product with your idea.</p>
