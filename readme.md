## Another idea
A new file system where each file resembles a webpage. The webpage needs to have a built-in editor for adding text, drawings and audio recordings, as well as embedding other contents, and most important of all, splitting one document into a child. It should provide easy linking from a child to a unique parent via an awesome interface that displays a bunch of trees.

We can also add version control blur the line between different copies vs symbolic copies.



It should allow for free files and easy linking of files. What's new is that there is no such thing as a folder, but a file with links, kind of like mongodb. A file can contain text a text editor with an audio recorder and picture drawer and easy way to split off a document.
